## Automated Zero-Downtime Deployment with CI/CD Pipelines

In this lab you will get learn how to automate deployments into production without the need for a service window and down time.

#### Background

In the previous labs you deployed and tested a code change directly in production without requiring downtime or a service window. Zero downtime deployments is an invaluable capability when building CI/CD pipelines in order to allow more frequent deployments in production without the need to go through cumbersome and bureaucratic processes for getting a change into production.

The manual blue/green deployment you followed in previous lab, is fun but not scalable for larger teams with many code commits per day. In this lab, you will automate blue/green deployment by integrating it into the Cart CI/CD pipeline. In that case, every time a change is committed to the code repository, the CI/CD pipeline would takes the code, build it and if successful in the Dev environment, promotes it into the inactive Cart container (the container that does NOT receive any production traffic) in the Prod environment. If the tests are successful in the Prod environment and after the release manager manually approves the Prod deployment, the CI/CD pipeline makes the new version live by switching the router and sending all traffic to the newly deployed container.

#### Blue-Green Deployment via CD/CD Pipeline

Open the Jenkinsfile you added to the pipelines Git repository in a text editor and replace its content with the following:

The above pipeline makes the following changes compared to the previous lab:

* _Promote_ stage is made aware of blue/green deployments
* _Approve_ stage is postponed till all tests are complete in the Prod environment
* _Go Live_ stage flips the router to send traffic to the new deployment

Notice that in the Promote stage, the pipeline retrieves the Cart route to check which version (blue or green) is receiving production flow and promotes the new Cart docker image to the inactive image which does not receive any product traffic. The Pipeline DSL is a Groovy syntax which is powerful for creating complex scenarios and enables dynamic decision making during pipeline execution similar to above.

Save the Jenkinsfile and push it to the Git repository and enter your credentials:

The purchase reports from CoolStore online shop show that reducing the minimum order to 40$ has had minimal effects on conversion rate which seem to be attributed to increased competition online. Pricing department has requested to reduce the minimum order to 20$ and evaluate the conversion rate after a week. Let’s push this change to production via the automated blue/green deployment in the pipeline.

Point your browser to the Git server web URL:

* Git Server URL:  `http://{{GIT_SERVER_URL}}`
* Username: `{{GIT_USER}}`
* Password: `{{GIT_PASSWORD}}`

In the *cart-service* repository, browse to the promotion service at `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/PromoService.java`, click on the pencil icon to open `PromoService.java` in the web editor and set the minimum order to 20$. The `PromoService.java` should look like this after the edit:

[source,java]
----
        //PROMO: if cart total is greater than 20, free shipping
        if ( shoppingCart.getCartItemTotal() >= 20) {
            ...
        }
----

Click on *Commit Changes* button to commit the new shipping promotion rule to the Git repository. Go back to OpenShift Web Console and in the _Dev_ project, click on *Builds -> Pipelines* on the left sidebar menu and wait until pipeline pauses at the *Approve Go Live* stage.

At this stage, a new version of the Cart service is deployed in the Prod environment as Cart Blue which does not receive any production traffic yet. Note that if you have executed  the Cart CI/CD pipeline multiple times, Cart Green might be the inactive deployment in your environment.

After deployment is ready, verify that the new minimum order for free shipping is working correctly in the inactive container by adding 1 smartwatch to the test shopping cart :

CAUTION: Replace the Cart route with routes in your project

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST http://{{CART_BLUE_ROUTE}}/api/cart/FOO/444434/1
{"cartItemTotal":24.0,"cartItemPromoSavings":0.0,"shippingTotal":0.0,"shippingPromoSavings":-2.99,"cartTotal":24.0,"shoppingCartItemList":[{"price":24.0,"quantity":1,"promoSavings":0.0,"product":{"itemId":"444434","name":"Pebble Smart Watch","desc":"Smart glasses and smart watches are perhaps two of the most exciting developments in recent years. ","price":24.0}}]}
----

Notice that the shipping cost is zero since the total order is above the 20$ minimum order. Click on the Web UI route URL and add a Pebble Smart Watch to your shopping cart. As expected, the shipping cost is not zero.

Now that the new minimum order rule is verified in the new version of Cart service in the Prod environment, you can approve the *Go Live*. Go back to *Builds -> Pipelines* and click on *Input Required* and then *Promote* to approve the Go Live. Add a Pebble Smart Watch to your shopping cart again and verify that shipping is now free in the live version.
